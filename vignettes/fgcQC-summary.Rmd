# Summary

`fgcQC` is an `R` package that provides implementations of CRISPR QC metric calcluations pertaining to sequencing, laboratory, and analysis metrics - both standard and novel metrics are included. It is designed to ingest data produced by the [AZ-CRUK CRISPR analysis pipeline](https://bitbucket.astrazeneca.com/projects/DA/repos/az-cruk-crispr-pipeline/browse).

# Dependencies

* `R` $\geq$ v3.6.1 (not tested on earlier versions).
* CRAN `R` packages: `dplyr`, `tibble`, `tidyr`, `magrittr`, `rlang`, `purrr`, `jsonlite`, `ineq`, `energy`, `PRROC`, `matrixcalc`
* Bioconductor `R` packages: `DSS`

# Design

* The main entry point is `QC_fgc_crispr_data()` and this function takes an analysis config JSON file, count data, bagel output, sequencing metrics (bcl2fastq), and a `cleanr.tsv` gRNA library file. 
* QC data is produced for a **single comparison** in the analysis config.
* QC metrics are saved to a `csv` (*non-confidential*) file and an `R` object containing the intermediate data is saved to an `rds` file (*confidential* - to be used for troubleshooting or more in-depth analyses and plotting).
* Each row of the output `csv` file corresponds to a single sample.
* All the QC calculation functions are exported and available to be used stand-alone within the `R` package.
* Lethality screens are handled by setting treatment file paths to `NULL` (see 'Usage' section below).

# Assumptions

* A `qc` section exists in the analysis config and contains a `date_transduced` variable for each sample.
* Sample Labels from the analysis config do not contain any **confidential** information.
* Index barcodes are unique within a single SLX_ID even if sequencing has occurred across more than one flowcell.
* Processing individual analysis comparisons one at a time is feasible.
* Non-targeting guides are named 'Control' in the gene column of the library file.
* CRISPR-i and CRISPR-a screens will only return sequencing QC metrics.

# Usage

In the below command, multiple `bcl2fastq` `Stats.json` files can be provided in a single comma-separated string. For 'lethality' screens, set the argument `bagel_treat_plasmid` to `NULL`.

```{r,eval=F}
qc <- QC_fgc_crispr_data(analysis_config = "path/to/analysis_config.json",
                         combined_counts = "path/to/combined_counts.csv",
                         bagel_ctrl_plasmid = "path/to/bagel_Control_vs_Plasmid.bf",
                         bagel_treat_plasmid = "path/to/bagel_Treatment_vs_Plasmid.bf",
                         bcl2fastq = "path/to/first/Stats.json,path/to/second/Stats.json",
                         library = "path/to/gRNA-library-file/cleanr.tsv",
                         comparison_name = "Single_Comparison_name",
                         output = "qc-out.csv",
                         output_R_object = "qc-out")

```

A summary of the return object can be printed to the console:

```{r,eval=F}
qc
####  fgcQC summary  ####
SLX_ID: SLX-19037
Screen Type: n
Screen Goal: lethality
Number of Flowcells: 1
AUROC for pan-cancer Sanger (Control vs Plasmid): 0.996
AUROC for Hart essentials (Control vs Plasmid): 0.887
AUROC for Moderately negative (Control vs Plasmid): 0.932
AUROC for Weakly negative (Control vs Plasmid): 0.634
```

# Unit Tests

All unit tests can be run from the root of the `R` package directory:

```{r,eval=F}
devtools::test("path/to/fgcQC")
```


# QC metrics

QC metrics to the left of the `SampleId` column are experiment-wide, comparison-wide, or calculated for pairs of samples (e.g. control vs plasmid). QC metrics to the right of the `SampleId` column are sample-specific metrics. In the below tables, `<comp>` is one of `ctrl_plasmid`, `treat_plasmid`, or `treat_ctrl`, and `<gene_set>` is the name of a gene set, e.g. `hart_essential`.

## Standard

|QC metric|Description|
----------|-----------|
`AUROC.<comp>.<gene_set>`|Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve for Bagel Bayes Factors.|
`AUPrRc.<comp>.<gene_set>`|Area Under the Precision-Recall curve for Bagel Bayes Factors.|
`Sensitivity_FDR_10pct.<comp>.<gene_set>`|Sensitivity at 10% FDR for Bagel Bayes Factors.|
`NNMD.<comp>.<gene_set>`|log2 fold change Null-Normalized Mean Difference relative to plasmid.|
`NNMD_robust.<comp>.<gene_set>`|log2 fold change Null-Normalized Mean Difference relative to plasmid defined using the median and median absolute deviation.|
`repl_log2FC_pearson_corr.<comp>`|Pearson correlation of log-fold change values for replicate pairs belonging to the same sample type. Only calculated for the first two replicates when there are >2 total replicates.|
`cas_activity`|Cas-9 activity.|
`virus_batch`|Batch ID of virus.|
`plasmid_batch`|Batch ID of plasmid.|
`minimum_split_cell_number`|Cell density when cell populations are split.|
`cell_population_doublings`|Doubling rate of cell lines.|
`library_dna_yield_ng.ul`|Amplified library DNA yield.|
`index_plate`|The index plate ID for prepping the library.|
`index_plate_well_id`|The well ID for the index plate.|
`percent_low_count_plasmid_gRNAs`|Percentage of plasmid gRNAs with less than 30 reads.|
`percent_zero_plasmid_gRNAs`|Percentage of plasmid gRNAs with zero-count reads.|

## Novel

|QC metric|Description|
----------|-----------|
`GICC.<comp>.<gene_set>`|Generalized Intraclass Correlation Coefficient of normalized counts - multivariate measure of reproducibility (fits a linear model and returns the proportion of the total variance attributable to between-sample variance). Values range between 0 and 1 - higher values indicate more reproducible data.|
`mahalanobis_dist_ratio.<comp>`|Mahalanobis distance ratio of control or treatment samples relative to the plasmid for normalized counts. Lower values indicate the control or treatment samples cluster away from the plasmid. Values $\geq$ 1 indicate control or treatment samples are close to the plasmid and should be investigated.|
`dispersion_adj_gRNA.treat_ctrl`|An empirical-Bayesian shrinkage estimator for the dispersion of gRNA counts - the mean across gRNAs is returned. Only calculated for Treatment-vs-Control.|
`distcorr_GC_content_counts`|A 'distance correlation' (allows for non-linear, non-monotonic relationships) for gRNA GC content and normalized counts|
`distcorr_GC_content_logfc.<comp>`|A 'distance correlation' (allows for non-linear, non-monotonic relationships) for gRNA GC content and log fold changes|
`gini_coefficient_counts`|The Gini coefficient for count data. Values range between 0 and 1 with high values indicating most reads belong to a small number of gRNAs.|
`norm_counts_GCC_ratio`|gRNAs with GCC in the 4 bases upstream of the PAM have been found to be inefficient. This metric captures the ratio of median normalized counts for gRNAs with GCC versus the median of all gRNAs.|
`norm_counts_TT_ratio`|gRNAs with TT in the 4 bases upstream of the PAM have been found to be inefficient. This metric captures the ratio of median normalized counts for gRNAs with TT versus the median of all gRNAs.|
`log2FC_GCC_diff.<comp>`|gRNAs with GCC in the 4 bases upstream of the PAM have been found to be inefficient. This metric captures the logFC difference for gRNAs with GCC versus all gRNAs.|
`log2FC_TT_diff.<comp>`|gRNAs with TT in the 4 bases upstream of the PAM have been found to be inefficient. This metric captures the logFC difference for gRNAs with TT versus all gRNAs.|
`NNMD.<comp>.control_guides`|NNMD for non-targeting control gRNAs. Expected to be > 0 since they do not incur the cost of dsDNA cuts.|
`NNMD_robust.<comp>.control_guides`|NNMD_robust for non-targeting control gRNAs. Expected to be > 0 since they do not incur the cost of dsDNA cuts.|

## Sequencing

When more than one flowcell has been used, the worst example of each flowcell-level QC metric is reported (min or max depending on the metric).

|QC metric|Description|
----------|-----------|
`ReadsPF_percent`|The percentage of reads Passing Filter (PF) for the experiment as a whole. Should be high.|
`Non_Demultiplexed_Reads_percent`|The percentage of non-demultiplexed reads for the experiment as a whole.|
`Sample_Representation`|The percentage of reads assigned to each sample.|
`percent_reads_matching_gRNAs`|The percentage of reads that match a gRNA sequence in each sample.|
`Q30_bases_percent`|The percentage of reads with quality scores in excess of 30 for each sample. Should be high.|
`Average_base_quality`|Average base quality score for each sample.|
`Index_OneBaseMismatch_percent`|The percentage of 1-base index mismatches per sample. Should be low.|
