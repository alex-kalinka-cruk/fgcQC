\usage{
calc_percent_matching_gRNAs(b2f_samples, counts)
}
\arguments{
\item{b2f_samples}{A data frame of sample information derived from `bcl2fastq2` output - see `extract_b2f_json`. The `SampleName` column should have been replaced with sample names hailing from the analysis config.}

\item{counts}{A data frame of counts for each sample in the study (samples as columns, gRNAs as rows).}
}
\value{
A data frame containing per-sample percent matching gRNA values in a column called `percent_reads_matching_gRNAs`.
}
\description{
Calculates the percentage of reads in each sample that can be assigned to any of the gRNA sequences.
}
