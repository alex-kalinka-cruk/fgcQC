  combined_counts,
  bagel_ctrl_plasmid,
  bcl2fastq,
  library,
  comparison,
  output
)
}
\arguments{
\item{analysis_config}{A path to a valid analysis config JSON file to be used as input for the AZ-CRUK CRISPR analysis pipeline.}

\item{combined_counts}{A path to a valid combined counts csv file (produced by the AZ-CRUK CRISPR analysis pipeline).}

\item{bagel_ctrl_plasmid}{A path to a valid Bagel tsv results file for Control vs Plasmid.}

\item{bcl2fastq}{A character string giving one or more paths to valid `bcl2fastq2` summary output JSON files (paths separated by commas).}

\item{library}{A valid path to a library tsv file in which the first column gives the sgRNA sequence and the second column gives the sgRNA ID (produced by the AZ-CRUK CRISPR reference data generation pipeline).}

\item{comparison}{A character string naming a single comparison to extract QC data for (should correspond to the comparison name used in the analysis config JSON file).}

\item{output}{A character string giving an output file name for the csv results. If `NULL`, do not write out any results.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing QC metrics as columns and samples as rows; this data will also be written out to the `output` file, if not `NULL`.
}
\description{
Produce Quality Control (QC) metrics from FGC CRISPR screen data inputs: an analysis config JSON file, a combined counts csv file, a Bagel results tsv file (Control vs Plasmid), a gRNA library tsv file ('cleanr.tsv'), and one or more bcl2fastq2 output JSON files. QC output will be generated for a single named comparison.
