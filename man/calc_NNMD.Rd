\usage{
calc_NNMD(data, gene_col, lfc_col, essential_genes, nonessential_genes)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data fram containing log fold change data (normalized in terms of library depth and any potential copy-number effects) for a set of genes.}

\item{gene_col}{A character string indicating which column contains gene names.}

\item{lfc_col}{A character string indicating which column contains $log_2$ fold change data for each gene.}

\item{essential_genes}{A vector of essential gene names.}

\item{nonessential_genes}{A vector of non-essential gene names.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value.
}
\description{
Calculates Null-Normalized Mean Difference (NNMD; also known as Glass's delta) for the log fold change distributions of essential and non-essential genes - defined as the mean difference divided by the standard deviation of non-essential genes (the reference set).
