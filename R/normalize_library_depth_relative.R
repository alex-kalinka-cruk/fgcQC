#' normalize_library_depth_relative
#'
#' Normalizes library depth from a counts file by dividing the counts of each sample by its total and multiplying all samples by a constant total number of reads.
#'
#' @param counts A data frame of counts for each sample in the study (samples as columns, gRNAs as rows).
#' @param norm_total An integer specifying the fixed total number of reads each sample will be set to (e.g. 2e7). If `NULL`, then the median total across the samples is used.
#'
#' @return A data frame in which the sample columns are library-depth normalized.
#' @export
